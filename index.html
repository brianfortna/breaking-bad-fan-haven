<h2><b><u>Quotes:</u></b></h2>
<br/>
<p><b>Walter White:</b></p>
<br/>
<p>"All I'm saying is, do you not even question this?! Do you really believe you mean anything to these people? And I'm not trying to be insulting I'm just trying to make you see things clearly."</p>
<br/>
<p>"This whole thing, all of this, it's all about me."</p>
<br/>
<p>"Day off?! We were on call you junkie, on call for the biggest deal of our lives and I just managed to pull it off by the skin of my teeth no thanks to you. And you, made me miss the birth of my daughter!"</p>
<br/>
<p>"Sitting around, smoking marijuana, eating Cheetos and masturbating do not constitute plans."</p>
<br/>
<p>"What is close? There's no close in science, Barry. There are right answers and wrong answers. Close didn't put men on the moon."</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><b>Jesse Pinkman:</b></p>
<br/>
<p>"This is my own private domicile and I will not be harrassed! Bitch!"</p>
<br/>
<p>"So you're chasing around a fly and in your world, I'm the idiot?"</p>
<br/>
<p>"Ahhhh, wire!"</p>
<br/>
<p>"Dude, it's called breakage, ok! Like K-Mart, shit breaks. It's the cost of business, yo!"</p>
<br/>
<p>"Why don't you have computers and shit, it's the twentieth century."</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><b>Hank Schrader:</b></p>
<br/>
<p>"I swear to Christ, I will put you under the jail!"</p>
<br/>
<p>"You're the smartest guy I ever met, but you're too stupid to see... he made up his mind ten minutes ago."</p>
<br/>
<p>"Damn, that chicks got an ass like an onion. Makes me wanna cry."</p>
<br/>
<p>"Corporate security? What's that, like, guarding the special sauce?"</p>
<br/>
<p>"Well, at least he didn't shit himself this time. Guess that's progress."</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><b>Gus Fring:</b></p>
<br/>
<p>"Has your condition worsened? You medical condition, has it grown worse? Is there a ringing in your ears, are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices?"</p>
<br/>
<p>"What does a man do, Walter? A man provides for his family. And he does it, even when he is not appreciated, or respected, or even loved. He simply bares up and he does it, because he is a man."</p>
<br/>
<p>"I will kill your wife, I will kill your son, I will kill your infant daughter."</p>
<br/>
<p>"This is what happens now: My men will come back inside and you will shake their hands and you will make peace and that will be the end of this."</p>
<br/>
<p>"I don't think we're alike at all, Mr. White. You are not a cautious man at all. Your partner was late, and he was high. He's high often, isn't he? You have poor judgment, I can't work with someone who has poor judgment."</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><b>Mike Ehrmantraut:</b></p>
<br/>
<p>"I assure you that I can kill you from way over here if it makes you feel any better."</p>
<br/>
<p>"Will you shut the fuck up and let me die in peace?"</p>
<br/>
<p>"I've known good criminals and bad cops. Bad priests, honorable thieves... you can be on one side of the law or the other. But if you make a deal with somebody, you keep your word."</p>
<br/>
<p>"The moral of the story is: I chose a half measure, when I should have gone all the way. I'll never make that mistake again."</p>
<br/>
<p>"Just because you shot Jesse James, don't make you Jesse James."</p>
